    <h2>I have a wide variety of interests.</h2>
    <p>
      Among my varied interests are Bicycling, Photography, Science, Computers,
      3D Printing, Martial Arts, Eastern Philosophy and Military History.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I said I am interested in Computers, I meant practically all aspects
      of computers. I have been "messing about" with them since the early 1980's. I play computer games, I build computers, I am studying a
      couple of different programming languages, and I am studying networking
      and computer security as well.
