<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  As I've mentioned, I have a wide variety of interests. Ever since childhood 
  I've found that I will come across a topic that I find interesting, then I
  dive into it deeply for a period of time and learn all I can about it. 
  Eventually, another topic catches my interest and I dive deeply into that 
  subject. As a result of this, I have a lot of knowledge about a lot of things.

<p>
  The topics I have explored in depth in my lifetime would fill a page, but here
  is a representative sample to show that it is not a single field. Anatomy,
  physics, Martial Arts, Mathematics, Eastern Religions and Philosophy, Military
  History, Veterinary Medicine, Physical Fitness, Computer Programming and more.

<p>
  I am currently studying computer programming with Python, webpage construction
  with HTML, the Japanese language, and electrical engineering.

  For hobbies, I ride my bicycles (Mountain Bike and Road Bike) and enjoy
  photography. I am semi-retired, which in my case means I only work one
  full-time job (I used to have two.) I have been a soldier, Jail Officer,
  Probation Officer, Aerospace parts inspector, machinist and retail worker and
  owned my own computer business. I like to stay busy, so I always have
  something going on.
