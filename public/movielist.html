      <p><li><h3>Casablanca</li></h3></p>
     An acknowledged classic, the acting is top-notch, the music thrilling and the multitude of lines everyone attributes to Humphrey Bogart are instantly recogniseable.</p>
      <p><li><h3>Act of Valor</h3></p>
      The reality of the missions of the Navy Seals without Hollywood "over the top" special effects like a single bullet blowing up a car, or a 15 minute gun battle without reloading. Probably the closest depiction of real combat you can find coming out of Hollywood.</p>
      <p><li><h3>Interstellar</h3></li>
      A science fiction movie that is about as close as you'll find depicting time dilation around a black hole or other super-massive object.  Some of the scenes are pure fiction, but some are actually based around real-world physics and other sciences.</p>
